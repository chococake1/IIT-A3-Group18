        <h1 style="text-align: center;">Project Description</h1>

        <p>The project that our group has decided to continue development on is the water level sensor within a pet’s bowl. This project will include the usage of an Arduino and a water sensor which would be used to monitor the water levels in a pet’s bowl. This project also includes an application that will send push notifications to the user’s phone when the water level is too low. This would allow the user to always be aware of when they need to refill the water bowl in order to ensure that their pets will consistently have access to water.
        </p>

        <h2>Passion's, Interests and Skills</h2>

        <p>Since this project requires development, both on the software and hardware, our group has split into sub-groups depending on our individual interests. Those who are interested on the software side would be assigned to the development of a prototype application and those who are more interested in the hardware would be working with the physical appliances that we purchased, that being the Arduino and the water sensor. Some of our members also have skills that they learnt prior to this assignment that was planned to be integrated into this project, such as fluency in programming using Unity. The application for the project was planned to be developed on Unity since it would be easier if we were to use skills that we already have and can use instead of learning new ones. Everything other than this, being the development and usage of the Arduino, the creation of prototypes and coordination of the software and hardware are fairly new skills that we have learnt which aligns with our general interests and passions.
        </p>

        <h2>IT Industry Trends</h2>

        <p>Due to the increased usage of smart tools as they are being “embedded in environments and artifacts invisibly”, our group thought it would be suitable to create a smart tool which would be able to help the users look after their pets with more ease. Since the Arduino and the water sensor is to be implemented into a modified section of a pet’s bowl that they cannot access, it would allow pets to safely drink their water. This tool was created with the idea in mind that it would be able to conveniently remind the user that their pet’s water bowl without having to physically check.
        </p>

        <h2>Assisting in Career Plans</h2>

        <p>Working on this project will most likely assist our group in gaining some of the skills necessary for our ideal jobs. The ideal jobs that our group is working towards includes a software engineer, developer programmer, penetration tester, software developer and IT helpdesk technician. The software side of the project would allow us to learn about basic programming which will be useful for every one of the jobs listed as they all require experience with a certain programming language. The hardware side of the project would be less useful for each of our ideal jobs but may still assist us since basic knowledge of hardware relating to IT can be beneficial regardless of the area of IT which each individual member will choose to specialise in.
