        <h2>Lachlan M:</h2>
        <p>I think generally the team worked quite well together, in large part due to our good planning & organization. I slotted into a project manager role in lieu of anyone else stepping up, and mostly focused on that as well as developing the majority of the website. I think we could have done better by setting due dates for work that could have been completed earlier, and enforcing them. A good amount of work was finalized and merged in the last week of the project, and I think it would have made things a lot easier to get that done a week or two beforehand during the Easter break. I was pleasantly surprised to see how well everyone communicated throughout the whole project. Meeting attendance was almost flawless, and we were in constant communication about updates to the project.
        <br><br>
        I think I’ve learned just how much a good organizational system, with deadlines can make a difference in a group project like this. I think we were quite good in this regard, but could have been even better.
        <br><br>
        I’ve added a couple of tools to our project management workflow to help us keep track of the team’s work. These tools were a Trello Board<sup><a href="references.html">[39]</a></sup> and a Microsoft Teams/Github Integration plugin<sup><a href="references.html">[40]</a></sup> that notifies the group when changes to the website have been made. Together I think these have helped us quite a bit in keeping track of tasks & their progress. I also think that due to the nature of how our workflow regarding the website was planned, the Github log activity is not a perfect way of measuring work from the team on the assignment. The majority of commits have been from me, as I was in charge of setting up the layout & structure of the site as well as adding placeholder content for the rest of the team to replace with their work. Because of this, the number of commits indicate a disproportionate amount of work was done by me, which absolutely is not the case. I felt we all shared the workload of the project very equally.

        <h2>Dominic G:</h2>
        <p>Within assignment 2 I worked on the IT technologies, overall, the write up went well with multiple sources found to develop an in depth write up. In addition, I believe our communication as a group was very good, everyone attending the meeting regularly and giving updates on teams when unable to attend the meetings, allowing us to know where everyone was up to. One thing that I believe could be improved for our group was to get everyone from the start to work off teams to track their progress rather than working off a personal word file but in the end, we were able to ensure everyone was on track. One thing I found surprising was how well everyone contributed to the group and there was not one member that didn’t fall behind in their work. One thing that I learned working in the group is that communication is vital as it allows everyone to know where everyone was up to and progress making it easier to hit our deadlines. Also, with good communication it ensures everyone knows what needs to be done and highlights any issues a team member may have. The GitHub commits I’ve done relatively reflect the work I’ve done but it wasn’t my main task developing the website, only inputting the work I’ve completed.  </p>

        <h2>Max R:</h2>
        <p>[PLACEHOLDER]</p>

        <h2>Neo T:</h2>
        <p>Assignment 2 was a report of our project idea, this required a lot of teamwork as the report contained several different aspects. Communication within our group was good, and deciding roles was done quickly, everyone was very flexible whenever new unexpected challenges arose.<br>
            Work could have been done faster, as even when nearing the due date, there was still a fair bit of work to be done. This could be improved upon by setting more clear deadlines. Such as what we expect to be specifically done by a certain date. <br>
            One thing that was surprising was how much less the work there was once we divided the workload, as when first viewing the assignment, it seemed to be a lot of work, after dividing it, it had become very manageable. <br>
            One thing I had learnt working in a group is that communication and organization is invaluable, work was much easier and clear than it would have been if we had not clearly assigned what each person’s roles were. <br>
            Viewing the GitHub log of activities, overall, the amount of commits I made were average within the group, most of my commits were obviously done within my page of industry data, most of this also applies to everyone else. Since Lachlan had made the website interface, he is the one who has made the most commits to the GitHub. </p>

        <h2>Joaquin R:</h2>
        <p>Overall, the assignment went well as very early on as we allocated tasks to each team member evenly splitting the workload. This ensured that from the begging we knew what we each needed to do allowing us to set clear goals on when certain subtasks had to be completed by. In terms of what could be improved is getting more work done during the first few weeks while we did a moderate amount of work, we could have significantly lightened our workload if we did more work earlier rather than later. One thing that was surprising was that what seemed like a lot of work initially was actually not that much once it was divided showcasing the advantage of having 6 people in our group. I have learned that the most important thing to do to ensure success when working in a group is communication. This is because communication allows everyone to be kept on the same page about what needs to be done and what has been done ensuring maximum efficiency and effectiveness of the time spent working. I think that the content of Github commits reflect group members work not the number of them as obviously those working on the website will have way more commits that those purely focusing on writing up the content.</p>

        <h2>Kiet N:</h2>
        <p>Overall, the teamwork between the group members for assignment two worked very well together. I was assigned to do the majority of the “Project Ideas” section of the assignment, and I was able to get the necessary assistance from my group members whenever I was unsure of something. The communication between the group members was consistent and the attendance for all the set meetings was nearly perfect. Even if a group member missed a meeting, the rest of the group would fill in the missing person on what was covered which would have saved them valuable time as they did not have to watch the recordings over again. Something that could have been improved could be the use of external organisational tools such as Trello. A Trello board was set up, but the group members would rarely interact with it unless it was brought up during a meeting. This made it somewhat difficult to gauge where each member was with their work. One thing that I was surprised about whilst working on this assignment was the communication during online group meetings. Since we had a group meeting plan every week and an instigator, being Lachlan, our meetings were always meaningful, and we rarely had an instance where it was just minutes of silence. One thing that I have learned about groups is that if the members would regularly update their progress every week, it makes it much easier to get work done by certain deadlines. I think my Github activity is average. This is mainly due to the group members writing their content on other tools such as Microsoft word and committing the entire thing onto Github. </p>

        <h2>Conclusion:</h2>
        <p>Overall, the group worked very well, communication between group members was of a very high standard. From each of the group reflections everyone stated that the attendance at the teams' meetings was nearly flawless, also, if a group member missed the meeting, they would provide an update afterward and the all then other team members would provide them a brief of what we covered within the meeting which was reflected in most of the group reflections. 
            <br><br>
            Many of the group members stated that we needed to get more work done during the first week of the assignment to avoid rushing at the end. In addition, organization between the members could have been improved, this includes everyone using the word docs in teams not working on a personal file this would help validate where everyone was up to. Also, another improvement we could have made that was stated in the group reflection was to ensure everyone’s work had a deadline, this was to ensure that the work was completed in a timely manner as we realised there was a lot of work to be completed in the last week.
            <br><br>
            As stated in the beginning, a lot of our group members stated that they found the level of communication and commitment to the work was very surprising. With everyone communicating consistently and attending group meetings. Also, within our group meetings the level of communication between each group member was very consistent with limited moments of silence. In addition, some of the group members stated that the amount of work was much less than expected when equally divided between the group.
            <br><br>
            Most of the individual group reflections stated that they learned how important communication is, allowing each team member to know where everyone is up to, what needs to be completed and if there are any issues with the work, overall making the work much easier.
            <br><br>
            Most of us agreed that the GitHub commits didn’t reflect the work everyone put in, with Lachlan responsible for the website he had many more commits compared to the rest of us. In addition, some of the tools we implemented to manage our time were a Trello Board, this assisted us to manage where everyone was up to and allowed us to make any comments on the work if required. Thus, most of us agreed that GitHub commits were not truly reflected of our work in the group and the tools we implemented were a good way of keeping track of everyone’s work.
